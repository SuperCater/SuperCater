# About me:

Hi, I’m @SuperCater or more commonly known online as Cater.

I'm mostly a backend developer but I can do some frontend stuff.

My biggest project is probably [Wrapblox](https://github.com/SuperCater/WrapBlox) which is still indev. Its a Roblox API wrapper.
I mostly use it for personal use in one of my discord bots but its open source since I hate noblox and I dont think anyone deserves the pain of having to use it.
